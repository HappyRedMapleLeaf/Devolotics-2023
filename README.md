Uses and contains the full FTC SDK (https://github.com/FIRST-Tech-Challenge/FtcRobotController), as well as some pre-made quickstart files for some libraries such as RoadRunner.

The classes written by myself and my team include:
- Everything under `TeamCode/src/main/java/OpMode`
- `TeamCode/src/main/java/org/firstinspires/ftc/teamcode/Auto.java`
- `TeamCode/src/main/java/org/firstinspires/ftc/teamcode/Driver.java`
- `TeamCode/src/main/java/org/firstinspires/ftc/teamcode/HardwareOpMode.java`
